// make the required variables //
greenballs, redballs, currentrow, loseStreak, correctGuesses, start and check button, array of words

// if player clicks on start button //
everything will get a reset, variables / words / lingoboard / scores / bingocard

// function for generating a new Word //
if player guesses correct word 
using a random function a random word will get picked from words array

// function for checking if word is correct (also the biggest function) //
every row will get selected
if the amount of guesses are more then the amount of rows a message will be displayed that the user has no more guesses and loseStreak will get higher
However if the player still hasnt lost, the function for creating a new word will be used

Now the logic for if the letter is in the word / right place in the word
first we need to get the active row
then we will get all the inputs from the active row
then the guess will be put in an array like this ['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e'];

if one of the inputs are empty there will be a message displayed and they have to try again

Then we loop through each letter of the guess
if the letter we are looping through is at the same index of the random generated word, the input border will get greenballs
else if the letter is included in the word, but not on the same index the input border will get orange
else nothing will happen and the border will stay gray

if player guesses the correct word
message will get displayed that user guessed the right word
losestreak will get reset, and correctGuesses will get upped
function for drawing a ball will be used (logic will be shown later)
if user still hasnt met the requirements to win / lose a new word will get created

// function for checking if player wins //
if player green balls === 3 (win)
if player red balls === 3 (lose)
if player correct guesses === 10 (win)
if player lose streak === 3 (loses)
if player has bingo line (wins)

// function for drawing balls //
array with green, red and even number ball
if the first drawn ball is red no second ball will be drawn

// function for bingo card //
first code to set up random numbered bingo card
if drawn ball === number bingo card background will get green
if bingocard has (horizontal / vertical / diagonal) line the user wins
